# kafka-kraft-docker

Just fork of [Kraft Kafka](https://github.com/bashj79/kafka-kraft-docker). Updated Kafka version to 3.3.1

As the docker image is also built by GitHub actions, you do not need to build by yourself.

## Getting started

### Run with Docker

```
docker run -p 9092:9092 -d ghcr.io/ruimo/kafka-kraft:latest
```

Check out [Docker Hub](https://registry.hub.docker.com/r/bashj79/kafka-kraft) for further details.
